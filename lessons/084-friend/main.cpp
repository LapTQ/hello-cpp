/* friend declaration

- a friend is a class or function (member or non-member) that has been granted 
  full access to the private and protected members of another class.

  (and thus does not have an implicit object), we must explicitly pass an Accumulator 
  object to print() to work with.

/* Friend classes

Nots:
- Display is a friend of Storage does not mean Storage is also a friend of Display.
- Nor is friendship inherited. If class A makes B a friend, classes derived from B are not friends of A.
- A friend class declaration acts as a forward declaration for the class being friended. 
  This means we do not need to forward declare the class being friended before friending it.
*/

class Storage
{
private:
    int m_nValue {};
public:
    Storage(int nValue)
       : m_nValue { nValue }
    { }

    // Make the Display class a friend of Storage
    friend class Display;
};

class Display
{

public:
    // Because Display is a friend of Storage, Display members can access the private members of Storage
    void displayStorage(const Storage& storage)
    {
        std::cout << storage.m_nValue << '\n';
    }
};


/* Friend member functions

- Instead of making an entire class a friend, you can make a single member function a friend.

- However, the process might be more complicated than you think:
  + Storage needs to seen the full definition of class Display => define Display before Storage.
  + Storage needs to be forward declaration before use in Display => forward declare Storage before Display.
  + Friend member functions needs to see the full definition of Storage to access its private members => define displayStorage outside of Display and after Storage.

- Fortunately, this pain is only necessary because weâ€™re trying to do everything in a single file.
   A better solution is to put each class definition in a separate header file, with the member function 
   definitions in corresponding .cpp files.
