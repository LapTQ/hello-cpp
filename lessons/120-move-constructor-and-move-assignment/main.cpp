Here is what happens:
- res is constructed in generateResource() => Resource acquired
- When res is returned by value, it's copy constructed to a temporary object => Resource acquired
- Res is destroyed => Resource destroyed
- The temporary object is copy assigned to mainres => Resource acquired
- The temporary object is destroyed => Resource destroyed
- mainres is destroyed => Resource destroyed 

=> not efficient. However, with move semantics, we can do better.

/* When is move constructor/assignment is called instead of copy constructor/assignment?

- They are called when they are defined and the argument is an rvalue.
- The copy constructor/assignment is called otherwise.
*/


/* Implicit move constructor and move assignment operator

The compiler will create an implicit move constructor and move assignment operator if all of the following are true:
+ There are no user-declared copy constructors or copy assignment operators.
+ There are no user-declared move constructors or move assignment operators.
+ There is no user-declared destructor.

These move functions will do a member-wise move as follows:
+ If member has a move constructor or move assignment (as appropriate), it will be invoked.
+ Otherwise, the member will be copied.

Warning: this means that pointers will be copied, not moved!
*/


/* Automatic l-values returned by value may be moved instead of copied

- In the generateResource2(), when res is returned by value, it is an l-value. But it is moved instead of copied.
- The C++ specification has a special rule: automatic objects returned from a function by value can be moved even if they are l-values.
*/


/* Disabling copying

- we can make our Auto_ptr4 better by disabling copying.
```
Auto_ptr5(const Auto_ptr5& a) = delete;
Auto_ptr5& operator=(const Auto_ptr5& a) = delete;
```

This is good because, we should probably passing Auto_ptr5 to a function by const l-value reference instead of by value.
This makes Auto_ptr5 smarter, and in fact the standard library contains a class very much like this one.

/* std::move

- in the mySwapCopy, we're making expensive but not necessary copies. a and b are l-values, so the copy constructor and copy assignment are called.

- std::move is a function that casts (using static_cast) its argument into an r-value reference, so that move semantics can be invoked

/* 
- When we move the value from a temporary object, it doesn’t matter what value the moved-from object is left with, 
  because the temporary object will be destroyed immediately anyway.
- Because we can continue to access these objects after their values have been moved, it is useful to know what value they are left with.
- There are two schools of thought here:
	+ One school believes that objects that have been moved from should be reset back to some default / zero state (like str in the example above).
	+ other school believes that we should do whatever is most convenient

	the C++ standard says, “Unless otherwise specified, moved-from objects shall be placed in a valid but unspecified state.”
	=> str can be any valid string, including an empty string, the original string => we should avoid using the value of a moved-from object, 
	as the results will be implementation-specific.

- With a moved-from object, it is safe to call any function that does not depend on the current value of the object.

- std::move can also be useful when sorting an array of elements. Many sorting algorithms work by swapping pairs of elements.
