/* constexpr keyword

- A constexpr variable is always a compile-time constant.
- constexpr variable must be initialized with a constant expression, otherwise a compilation error will result.
*/

/* const vs constexpr

- const means that the value of an object cannot be changed after initialization. 
  The value of the initializer may be known at compile-time or runtime.
- constexpr means that the object can be used in a constant expression. The value of the initializer 
  must be known at compile-time. The constexpr object can be evaluated at runtime or compile-time.

- Constexpr variables are implicitly const.
- Unlike const, constexpr is not part of an objectâ€™s type. Therefore a variable defined as 
  constexpr int actually has type const int (due to the implicit const that constexpr provides for objects).
*/

/* constexpr functions

- A constexpr function is a function that can be called in a constant expression.
- a constexpr function may be evaluated at either compile-time or runtime.
- To be eligible for compile-time execution, all arguments must be constant expressions.
- A constexpr function must evaluate at compile-time when the constant expression it is part of must evaluate at compile time.

/* Constant as array length

- In many cases, it would be preferable to use a symbolic constant as an array length.
- In C, this can be done via a preprocessor macro, or via an enumerator, but not via a const variable.
- Variables was generally assumed to be known only at runtime, which made them ineligible to be used as array lengths.

- To solve this problem, the C++ language standard added an exemption so that 
  const integral types with a constant expression initializer are usable as array lengths:
const int arrLen = 5;
int arr[arrLen]; // ok: array of 5 ints
