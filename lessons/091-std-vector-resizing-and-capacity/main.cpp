/* length vs capacity of a std::vector

- capacity is how many elements the std::vector has allocated storage for
- length is how many elements are currently being used.

- A std::vector with a capacity of 5 has allocated space for 5 elements. 
  If the vector contains 2 elements in active use, the length (size) of the vector is 2. 
  The 3 remaining elements have memory allocated for them, but they are not 
  considered to be in active use. They can be used later without overflowing the vector.
*/


/* Shrinking a std::vector

- std::vector has a member function called shrink_to_fit() that requests that the vector 
  shrink its capacity to match its length.
  Note that This request is non-binding, meaning the implementation is free to ignore it.

{
    // Resize a std::vector at runtime

/* Reallocation of storage, and why it is expensive

Reallocation process:
- The std::vector acquires new memory with capacity for the desired number of elements.
  These elements are value-initialized.
- The elements in the old memory are copied (or moved, if possible) into the new memory.
  The old memory is then returned to the system.
- The capacity and length of the std::vector are set to the new values.

Reallocation is an expensive process.
