    std::cout << "I have " << centsSum2.getCents() << " cents.\n";

	// Using normal functions
	Cents centsSub{ cents1 - cents2 }; // -2
	std::cout << "I have " << centsSub.getCents() << " cents.\n";


	// Using member functions

/* 
- When dealing with binary operators that donâ€™t modify the left operand (e.g. operator+), the normal or friend function version is typically preferred.
- When dealing with binary operators that do modify the left operand (e.g. operator+=), the member function version is typically preferred.
- Unary operators are usually overloaded as member functions as well, since the member version has no parameters.
