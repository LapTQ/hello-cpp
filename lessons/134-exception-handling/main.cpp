/* throw, try, and catch

- In C++, a throw statement is used to signal that an exception or error case has occurred.
- You can any data type you wish. For example:
    ```
    throw -1; // throw a literal integer value
    throw ENUM_INVALID_INDEX; // throw an enum value
    throw "Can not take square root of negative number"; // throw a literal C-style (const char*) string
    throw dX; // throw a double variable that was previously defined
    throw MyException("Fatal Error"); // Throw an object of class MyException
    ```

- The catch keyword is used to define a block of code hat handles exceptions for a single data type.
  For example:
  ```
  catch (int x)
    {
        // Handle an exception of type int here
    }
- exceptions of non-fundamental types should be caught by const reference to avoid making an unnecessary copy.
    For example:
    ```
    catch (const MyException& e)
        {
            // Handle an exception of type MyException here
        }
    ```
- Just like with functions, if the parameter is not going to be used in the catch block, the variable name can be omitted:
    ```
    catch (int)
        {
            // Handle an exception of type int here
        }
    ```
*/


/* stack unwinding

- when a function throws an exception, the program will look for a catch block that can handle the exception.
- if a handler is not found in the current function, it will look in the calling function and so on up the call stack
  until it finds a catch block that can handle the exception, or no handler can be found.
- If a matching handler is found, the stack is unwound.
- If no handler is found, the stack might or might not be unwound.
    => local variables will not be destroyed => any cleanup expected upon destruction of said variables will not happen!!!
    => Fortunately, C++ also provides us with a mechanism to catch all types of exceptions: catch-all handler.
*/


#include <iostream>

int func1()
{
	try
	{
		throw 5; // throw an int exception
	}
	catch (double x)
	{
		std::cout << "We caught an exception of type double: " << x << '\n';
	}
	catch (...) // catch-all handler
	{
		std::cout << "We caught an exception of an undetermined type\n";
	}
}


/* Debugging unhandled exceptions

- if we have a catch-all handler, then we might lose useful diagnostic information.
- Therefore, in debug builds, it can be useful to disable the catch-all handler with the following template:
  ...
  Syntactically, a try block requires at least one associated catch block => we create a dummy class that can't be instantiated
  to satisfy the compiler.
*/

#include <iostream>

void runGame()
{
    throw 1;
}

class DummyException // a dummy class that can't be instantiated
{
    DummyException() = delete;
};

int func2()
{

    try
    {
        runGame();
    }
#ifndef NDEBUG // if we're in release node
    catch(...) // compile in the catch-all handler
    {
        std::cerr << "Abnormal termination\n";
    }
#else // in debug mode, compile in a catch that will never be hit (for syntactic reasons)
    catch(DummyException)
    {
    }
#endif

    return 0;
}


/* Catch-all handlers

- C++ also provides us with a mechanism to catch all types of exceptions
*/


/* If a constructor must fail for some reason, simply throw an exception
...  in such a case, the objectâ€™s construction is aborted, and all class members are destructed as per usual.
*/


/* Exceptions and inheritance

- exception handler will also match classes derived from the exception class.
*/

#include <iostream>

class Base1
{
public:
    Base1() {}
};

class Derived2: public Base1
{
public:
    Derived2() {}
};

int main()
{
    try
    {
        throw Derived2();
    }
    catch (const Base1& base)   // Catch here
    {
        std::cerr << "caught Base";
    }
    catch (const Derived2& derived)
    {
        std::cerr << "caught Derived";
    }

    return 0;
}


/* std::exception

- Many of the classes and operators in the standard library throw exception classes on failure.
  e.g.: std::bad_alloc, std::bad_cast, ...
- all of these exception classes are derived from a single class called std::exception.
*/

int func3()
{
    try
    {
        throw std::runtime_error("An error occurred");
    }
    catch (const std::exception& e)
    {
        std::cerr << "Caught an exception: " << e.what() << '\n';
    }
}


/* The lifetime of exceptions

- The object being thrown is typically a temporary object or a local variable.
  But recall that when a function throws an exception, the stack is unwound.
  SO how can the object being thrown persist after the function has been exited?
- The answer is that the object is copied to some piece of memory (outside the stack).
  => the object being thrown generally need to be copyable.
