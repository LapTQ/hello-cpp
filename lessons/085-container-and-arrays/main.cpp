/* Arrays

- An array is a container data type that stores a sequence of values contiguously (in an adjacent memory location, with no gaps).

- C++ contains three primary array types: 
  + (C-style) arrays: sometimes called “naked arrays”, “fixed-sized arrays”, “fixed arrays”, or “built-in arrays”.
    C-style arrays behave strangely and they are dangerous.
  + std::vector container class: the most flexible of the three array types.
  + std::array container class: introduced in C++11 as a direct replacement for C-style arrays. 
    It is more limited than std::vector, but can also be more efficient, especially for smaller arrays.
*/


/* 
Terminology:
- We will use `container classes` when we’re talking about something that applies to most or all the standard library containers classes.
- We will use array when we’re talking about something that generally applies to all array types, even ones implemented in other programming languages.
