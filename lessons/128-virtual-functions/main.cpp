/* Pointers and references to the base class of derived objects

- C++ will let us set a base pointer or reference to a derived object.
- a base reference and pointer can only see members of the base class.
  Consequently, pAnimal->speak() calls Animal::speak() rather than the Cat::speak() function.

/* Virtual functions and polymorphism

- A virtual function, when called, resolves to the "most-derived" version of the function for the "actual type" of the object being referenced or pointed to.

- But note that, Calling a virtual member function directly on an object (not through a pointer or reference) will always invoke 
  the member function belonging to the same type of that object.
  => Virtual function resolution only works when a member function is called through a pointer or reference to a class type object.

- if a function is marked as virtual, all matching overrides in derived classes are also implicitly considered virtual, 
  even if they are not explicitly marked as such.

/* A warning: call virtual functions from constructors or destructors.

- When you create an object of a derived class, the base class constructor is called first.
  If you were to call a virtual function from the base class constructor, it will call the base class version of the function
  because the derived class part of the object has not been constructed yet for the derived class version of the function to work with.

- Similarly, when you destroy an object of a derived class, the derived portion of the object is destroyed first...

/* why not just make all functions virtual

- because itâ€™s inefficient -- resolving a virtual function call takes longer than resolving a regular one.
- Furthermore, to make virtual functions work, the compiler has to allocate an extra pointer 
  for each object of a class that has virtual functions. This adds a lot of overhead to objects that otherwise have a small size.
