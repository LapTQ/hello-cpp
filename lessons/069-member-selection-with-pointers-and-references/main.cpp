/* Reminder: Member selection for "structs" and "references to structs"

- Use member selection operator (.)
*/

/* Member selection for "pointers to structs"

Solution 1: `(*ptr).member`
    => ugly
Solution 2: use operator (->): `ptr->member`
    => preferred

- The operator-> can be chained together: e.g, triangle->point1->y
