/*
There are 3 basic file I/O classes in C++:
    + ifstream: input
    + ofstream: output
    + fstream: input/output 
*/


/* File output

- there are several ways to close a file: 
    + explicitly call the close() function, 
    + or just let the file I/O variable go out of scope

- Output in C++ may be buffered. One way to cause the buffer to be flushed is to close the file.
    If program terminates immediately (either by crashing, or by calling exit()), the file may not be closed,
    which means the buffer may not be flushed.
    => it's a good idea to explicitly close the file.

Read: io-file-mode.png

  e.g., fstream defaults to `std::ios::in | std::ios::out`, meaning that you can read and write to the file.
