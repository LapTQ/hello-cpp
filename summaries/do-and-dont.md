## Print newline

* ✅ Use character `"\n"`:
* ❌ Avoid using `std::endl`. It flushes the buffer, which is slower.

## Comma operator

* ❌ Avoid using **comma operator**, except in `for` loops:
```C++
std::cout << (++x, ++y) << '\n'; // evaluates left and right, then retuns the right operand
```


## Macro

* ✅ Can use `#if 0` to comment out a large block of code that contains **multi-line comments**. Change it to `#if 1` when needed.
* ❌ Avoid using **object-like macros with substitution text**, as better methods are available.


## `#include` and header files

* ❌ Avoid `#including` .cpp files.
* Including header files from other directories:
    * ❌ Avoid using relative path (e.g, `#include "headers/myHeader.h"`).
    * ✅ Instead, tell your compiler about other locations to search for (e.g., `-I./lessons/11-header-files/others`).
* ✅ To maximize the chance that missing includes will be flagged by compiler, order your `#includes` as follows:
    1. the paired header file (`add.cpp` and `#include "add.h"`)
    2. other headers from same project
    3. 3rd party lib headers
    4. standard lib headers
* ✅ Always have a **header guard** in a header file to avoid violating ODR from having **a** code file #include a header (which may contain **definition**) multiple time. 
    * ⚠️ However, header guards do not prevent **multiple** code file `#include` the same header.
* ❌ Don't use `#pragme once`. Use header guard instead.
* ✅ Use a complex name for your header guard (e.g., `PROJECT_PATH_FILE_H`). This is to avoid case where 2 separated header files (e.g., `A/config.h` and `B/config.h`) might have the same name of header guard (e.g., `CONFIG_H`).


## Debugging

* ✅ use `std::cerr` (not buffered) instead of `std::cout` (may be buffered).
* To enable/disable debugging mode:
    * 👍 Solution 1: Conditionalizing your debugging code with macro: `#define ENABLE_DEBUG` in a header file and `#include` it everywhere. But ensure that you're not misspell `ENABLE_DEBUG` or forgot `#include` the header file.
    * 👍 Use `plog` logger. ❌ Don't use `std::clog` logger.


## Data types

* ❌ Avoid using unsigned types.
* ❌ Avoid `short`, `long`, fast/least integral types (prefer a fixed-width integer type instead).
* ❌ Avoid 8-bit fixed-width integer types (prefer a 16-bit fixed-width integer type instead).
* ❌ Avoid `long double`.
* ⚠️ `std::int8_t` and `std::uint8_t` likely behave like `signed char` and `unsigned char` instead of integers.


### Input text

* To read whitespace characters (type `char`):
    * ❌ can't use `std::cin >>`
    * ✅ use `std::cin.get(ch)`
* To read a line (including whitespace):
    * ❌ don't use `std::cin >>`
    * ✅ use `std::getline()`


## Compile-time optimization

* ✅ Most compilers default to no optimization, so if you’re using a command-line 
  compiler, you’ll need to enable optimization yourself.


## Using `std:string` and `std::string_view`

* ⚠️ Don't pass a `std::string` to a function by value. Because, it will make an expensive copy.
* ✅ Use `std::string_view` when passing a string to a function by value for read-only access purpose to avoid expensive copy.
* ✅ To view a substring of a string, use `std::string_view` with `.remove_prefix()` and `.remove_suffix()`.
* Initialize a `std::string_view`:
    * ❌ Don't initialize with a `std::string` **literal**. Because, the temporary `std::string` literal will be destroyed at the end of the statement:

        ```C++
        std::string_view name { "Alex"s }; // "Alex"s creates a temporary std::string
        std::cout << name << '\n'; // undefined behavior
        ```
    * 👍 It's okay to initialize with a C-style string **literal** or a `std::string_view` **literal**. Because, C-style string literals exist for the entire program.
* ⚠️ Returning a string in a function that has return type `std::string_view`: 2 main cases when this can be done safely:
    * 👍 when the returned object is a C-style string literals:

        ```C++
        std::string_view getBoolName(bool b)
        {
            return "false";
        }
        ```
    * 👍 when the returned object is a function parameter of type `std::string_view`:

        ```C++
        std::string_view firstAlphabetical(std::string_view s1, std::string_view s2)
        {
            if (s1 < s2)
                return s1;
            return s2;
        }
        ```


## Comparing floating point values

* ❌ It's very dangerous to compare floating point values directly using relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=).
    * 👍 One exception: compare a floating point **literal** with a **variable of the same type** that has been initialized with a **literal of the same type**.
* ❌ It's generally not safe to compare floating point values of **different** types.


## `goto` statement

* ❌ Avoid using `goto` statement.
* ✅ Exception: when you need to exit a nested loop.


## Pseudo-random number generation

* 👍 For most applications, Mersenne Twister is fine. However, by modern PRNG standards, Mersenne Twister is a bit outdated.
* ✅ For highest/fastest quality random results, consider:
    * The Xoshiro family and Wyrand for non-cryptographic PRNGs.
    * The Chacha family for cryptographic (non-predictable) PRNGs.


## Namespaces

* ✅ Naming convention: Company or org :: project or library :: module (e.g. `Foosoft::Foologger::Lang`)
* ✅ Prefer defineing global variables inside a namespace rather than in the global namespace.
* ❌ Do not use using-statements in header files.
* ❌ Do not use using-statements before an #include directive.
* ✅ If you want to version your code, you can use **inline namespaces**.


## Linkage

* ✅ If you want to make all declarations to have internal linkage without having to use `static` keyword, you can put them in an unnamed namespace.
    

## Share variables across multiple files

* Global **constants**:
    * 👍 Solution 1: Global constants as internal variables
        1. Create a header file and define a namespace in it.
        2. Put the global constants inside the namespace, make it `constexpr`.
        3. `#include` the header file wherever you need.

        * 👍 Simple
        * 👎️ Changing in the header file will require recompiling all files that include it.
        * 👎️ Each translation unit get its own copy of the constants => use more memory.
    * 👍 Solution 2: Global constants as external variables
        1. Create a .cpp file and define a namespace in it.
        2. Put the global constants inside the namespace, make it `extern constexpr`.
        3. Create a header file and forward declare the global constants.
        4. `#include` the header file wherever you need.

        * 👍 Changeing the constant only require recompiling the .cpp file.
        * 👎️ Because forward declarations can’t be constexpr, the constant cannot be used in constant expression outside of the .cpp file which defines the constant.
    * ✅ Solution3: Global constants as inline variables:
        1. Create a header file and define a namespace in it.
        2. Put the global constants inside the namespace, make it `inline constexpr`.
        3. `#include` the header file wherever you need.

        * 👍 The constants will only be instantiated once and shared across all code files (linker will de-duplicate definition).
        * 👍 Can be used in constant expressions in any translation unit.
        * 👎️ Changing in the headeer file will require recompiling all files that include it.


## Assertion

* ✅ Favor `static_assert` over `assert()` whenever possible.


## Explicit type conversion

* ✅ Use `static_cast` for most type conversions.
* ❌ Do not use C-style casts: e.g., `(int) x`.
* ❌ Do not use const cast and reinterpret cast unless you have a very good reason.


## Type deduction

* ✅ Can use **trailing return type syntax** to make code more readable and dynamic. E.g., this function has return type based on its parameter types: `auto add(int x, double y) -> std::common_type_t<decltype(x), decltype(y)>;`


## Function templates

* ✅ Use non-type template parameters to when we need to pass constexpr values to functions/class types. For example, to `static_assert` at compile time.







Inline functions are typically defined in "header" files, where they can be #included into the top of any code file 
   that needs to see the full definition of the identifier. This ensures that all inline definitions for an identifier are "identical".
   This is particularly useful for "header-only libraries" (no .cpp files are included).

Why not make all functions inline and defined in a header file?
- Mainly because doing so can increase your compile times significantly.
- Conversely, if you change the code in a .cpp file, only that .cpp file needs to be recompiled.
- If you change any of the code in the header, then you’ll need to recompile every file that includes that header.
